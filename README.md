A todo list for the terminal.

This is a rewrite of our old [tdo](https://github.com/tdolist/tdo).

This is a simple todo list tool that integrates in your terminal workflow.  
Featuring multiple todo lists and exporting your list to Markdown, it aims to be a well-structured assistant in your daily routine when you don't feel like leaving the terminal.

## Future features:
- [ ] different themes
- [ ] Server sync
